## What is this project about?

This is an implementation of the Game of Life, first developed by the mathematician John Conway, using the JavaScript library React.

## What problem does it solve?

John Conway initially devised this algorithm in search of an interesting and unpredictable cell automaton.

## Exceptional difficulties and solutions?

Converting the rules of the Game of Life into code proved to be quite the challenge, but upon further research a solution was reached through the use of multiple conditional statements outlining specific scenarios which rendered a cell "dead" or "alive".

## TODO list/wishlist.

Further features to potentially add down the road include being able to manually step through the simulation one generation at a time, and calculate the configuration of cells at a specified point in time, thereby bypassing animations.

## Simulation installation

Simply run `npm install` and `npm start` to access the game simulation through localhost:3000.

Alternatively, the game is also hosted and deployed at gameoflife-ys.netlify.app
